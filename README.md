    This is a project for Reinforcement Learning
    The project contains two packages, i.e. Environment and RLBrain.
    In the Environment packages, there is an implementation of easy-21.
    While the MontoCarloControl algorithm is in the RLBrain packages.
    In future, I will add new environments and reinforcement learning algorithms to this project. 
    Users can run the run_MC.py to implement MontoCarloControl on easy-21.
